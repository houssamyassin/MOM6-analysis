## MOM6-analysis
This repository contains tools for loading, analyzing, and visualizing [MOM6 ocean model](https://github.com/mom-ocean/MOM6) output. It builds file paths, handles custom data-token formats, opens and merges NetCDF files, computes common diagnostics, and makes both global and regional plots. Its purpose is to make working with multiple MOM6 simulations straightforward.

Within the Notebooks folder are Jupyter notebooks that compute and plot various diagnostics for my manuscript testing backscatter parameterizations in global ocean models.
